# Codex Logic

This project implements a simple stock prediction pipeline. The `!gather` command collects news, analyzes sentiment via OpenAI, predicts stock movement, and writes a report. The `!evaluate` command looks at the latest report and fetches real stock data to evaluate prediction accuracy. GitPython automatically commits reports and evaluations.
